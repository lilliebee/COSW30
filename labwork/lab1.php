        <h1>All About Me</h1>
        <p>I am Karen, I have been a student at Long Beach City College for the past year. I am fairly new to web development but completely fell in love with it after taking COSW10, I am very excited to learn all aspects of the field and hopefully get to one day apply it to land myself a job at Nordy's as a web designer. I enjoy hiking, cooking, photographing my babies and fur babies, and spending time with them in general.  </p>

print "<p>My favorite website is <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com\">Youtube</a> hands down I use it for just about everything and it's especially been a huge help ever since I decided to learn about the computer field. Whenever I am not watching videos in Youtube I am usually on <a href=\"http://www.pinterest.com\">Pinterest</a> attempting DIY's.</p>";
print "<p> This first assignment was pretty dang challenging. I struggled with pushing the file to git and then afterwards couldn't figure out why heroku deployed an empty web page after extensive google searches I hoped onto the class discord chat and found the answer *dramatic pause* I wasn't typing in the whole link correctly. Now that I've figured out my mistakes I am hoping I'll be able to understand everything a bit more."
