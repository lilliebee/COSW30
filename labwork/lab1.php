<?php 
print "<p>My favorite website is <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com\">Youtube</a>hands down I use it for just about everything and it's especially been a huge help ever since I decided to learn about the computer field. Whenever I am not watching videos in Youtube I am usually on Pinterest <a href=\"http://www.pinterest.com\">Pinterest</a>.</p>";
print "<p> To be completely honest this first lab was really difficult for me. I struggled the most with the php links and pushing it to git. I am hoping with more practice and my book I'll be able to understand everything a bit more."
